# LightSys Automation (name pending)

Lightsys automation aims at automatically providing .csv files with info about fixtures in a rig. This can in turn be utilised to generate labels for said fixtures. Also it is possible to calculate the distributed load on different circuits and therefore do loadbalancing and get suggestions on how to distribute the power from a source. In addition we can display other info like truss weight, splitter count, total powerusage on average and max and so on. 

## Pro's

- Way quicker than manually creating it
- Can add the exact information we want
- Full control over custom power, fixtures, systems and so on. 

## Con's 

- Tools like capture, vecctor works and so on allready delivers posibility for exporting rigs. Allthough information about fixtures may vary.
- Can't seamlessly integrate with the likes of capture, wyg, MA etc..

## Possible fixes

- Implementing support for GDTF would probably make integrating with visualisers. 
- Implementing som import of .csv would also help.
